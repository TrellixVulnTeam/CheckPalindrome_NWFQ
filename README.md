# CheckPalindrome
Parse a string input and returns if it is a palindrome or not
Punctuation and spacing in the input are ignored to make inputs less strict.
Ex "Do geese see God?" is a valid input and returns True as its considered a palindrome phrase, but if "?" was considered in the phrase it would technically return False
as there is no "?" in the start of the string
