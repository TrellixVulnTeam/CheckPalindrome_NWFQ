# CheckPalindrome
Parse a string input and returns if it is a palindrome or not
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same both left-to-right and right-to-left
Common Example: "Racecar" or "Amore, Roma"
See Tests folder for more valid (and invalid) inputs!
Punctuation and spacing in the input are ignored to make inputs less strict
Ex "Do geese see God?" is a valid input and returns True as its considered a palindrome phrase, but if "?" was considered in the phrase it would technically return False
as there is no "?" in the start of the string
